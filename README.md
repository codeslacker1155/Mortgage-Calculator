# Mortgage-Calculator

Mortgage-Calculator is a simple program that ask the user for the starting principal, interest rate, and mortgage length. The program then makes a calculation and returns output to the user.

## Description

This is a simple program that shows how to use bash scripts in a basic way to get user input and provide output to the user on what the monthly mortgage payment would be. The program is a static command line program that shows the user in a visual fashion what the mortgage payment is going to be by taking the principal (no commas), the interest rate (percent), and the loan term (months) and making a simple calculation.
